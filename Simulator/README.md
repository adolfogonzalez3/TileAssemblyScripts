# Python Tile Simulator
The Simulator.py script contains a class which simulates standard aTam with no negative glues.

The simulators purpose is to quickly develop and test new algorithms that may improve the performance of the java implementation. It may also be used as a general aTam simulator if necessary.

A secondary purpose is to attempt k-PATS. Prototypes can be built quickly in order to test ideas that may enhance the speed at which hard patterns are found.

- Currently being worked on.
